   Nexus Id cache

   In structural models, many signals refer to the same nexus.
   Some structural models also have very many signals.  This cache
   saves nexus_id - vcd_id pairs, and reuses the vcd_id when a signal
   refers to a nexus that is already dumped.

   The new signal will be listed as a $var, but no callback
   will be installed.  This saves considerable CPU time and leads
   to smaller VCD files.

   The _vpiNexusId is a private (int) property of IVL simulators.
